# Report on Destiny War NFT Game Website

## Overview:
The Destiny War website showcases an upcoming NFT-based MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that integrates Play-to-Earn (P2E) mechanics. The game allows players to collect digital assets like warriors, pets, mounts, and crafting scrolls in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). These assets can be used in the game or traded for real-world value on NFT marketplaces.
The website design is vibrant and visually engaging, with cartoonish fantasy characters and environments, likely intended to attract players with a love for adventure and role-playing games. The website prominently features calls-to-action, including "Click to Play" buttons and a "Pre-Sale" section for NFT assets.

## Key Website Features:
### Homepage Design:
#### Destiny War Branding: 
The homepage features a lively and animated game title logo, "Destiny War," with fantasy characters surrounding it. The visual design reinforces the game’s focus on a battle-oriented fantasy world.
#### Play Button: 
A "Click to Play" button is highly visible on the homepage, suggesting quick and easy access to the game for players. However, based on the user's feedback, the button does not function correctly and does not lead to any active game or content when clicked.
### Pre-Sale of NFTs:
#### Limited Pre-Sale Offering: 
The website highlights an NFT pre-sale, where players can buy 10,000 NFTs, including warriors, pets, and mounts. Each warrior comes with randomized features, including wings, costumes, and destiny boxes.
#### NFT Marketplace: 
After the pre-sale ends, NFTs will no longer be available through direct sales, and players will have to trade with other players in a decentralized marketplace. This feature emphasizes the rarity and value of these NFTs.
#### "Approve" Buttons: 
Buttons labeled "Approve" are visible next to the various pre-sale NFT items, suggesting a mechanism to approve transactions or purchases. However, as noted, these buttons are currently non-functional and do not trigger any actions or processes.
### Play-to-Earn (P2E) Mechanism:
#### P2E Gameplay: 
The site promotes a Play-to-Earn model, where players can earn in-game rewards, such as $Dwar tokens and crafting scrolls, by sending their mounts and pets on expeditions. These tokens and items can likely be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or traded as NFTs, giving players a chance to monetize their gameplay.
#### Expedition Mode: 
Expedition mode is a key feature where players can gather resources and rewards by sending their NFT-owned assets on missions. This mode seems to be central to the game’s economy.
### Gameplay Focus:
#### Character Classes: 
The website features descriptions of various character classes in the game. One example provided is the Ninja class, which specializes in close combat with flexible weapons and various effects. These classes appear to add variety and tactical depth to the game's combat system.
#### NFT Crafting Scrolls: 
The site features NFT Crafting Scrolls for weapons, equipment, and accessories, allowing players to customize and enhance their in-game gear. This feature adds depth to the gameplay by enabling players to modify their characters and increase their combat effectiveness.
### Roadmap and Future Plans:
The roadmap outlines the development phases for Destiny War:
Q4 2024: Initial Token and NFT Offering.
Q4 2024: Launch of expedition mode and the in-game crafting system.
Q4 2026: Expansion of the NFT scrolls system, adding more variety to crafting and player customization.
This roadmap reflects the developers' long-term vision and gives potential players confidence in the continued development of the game.

## Identified Issues:
### Non-Functional Buttons:
"Click to Play" Button: One of the main interactive features on the homepage, the "Click to Play" button, is not functioning properly. When clicked, the button does not load any game content or take the user to a playable area. This issue significantly impacts the user experience, as players expect to be able to access the game directly from the homepage.
"Approve" Buttons: Similar to the "Click to Play" button, the "Approve" buttons next to the NFT items in the Pre-Sale section are also non-functional. These buttons appear to be intended for approving transactions related to NFT purchases, but their non-functionality leaves players unable to interact with the NFT marketplace or pre-sale process.
### Lack of Detailed Gameplay Information:
While the website highlights the P2E model and mentions classes like the Ninja, it does not provide in-depth information about the overall gameplay, mechanics, or story. Potential players might benefit from a more detailed explanation of what to expect when playing Destiny War, such as combat mechanics, multiplayer features, and player progression.
### Token and Economic Model Clarity:
Although $Dwar tokens are mentioned as part of the expedition rewards, the website does not go into detail about the broader tokenomics of the game. There is little information on how these tokens can be used in the wider ecosystem or how players can exchange them for real-world value.
### Community Engagement:
The site provides links to social media platforms, but it does not offer a clear way for potential players to engage with an active community or gain updates on the game’s development. A live news feed, blog, or community forum could help build player engagement and trust in the project.

## Recommendations:
### Fix the Interactive Elements:
The primary focus should be on addressing the non-functional buttons, particularly the "Click to Play" and "Approve" buttons. Ensuring these are operational will help smooth the user experience and allow potential players and investors to engage with the game and its pre-sale features.
### Provide More Gameplay and Tokenomics Information:
Detailed gameplay mechanics and clearer information about how the P2E model works, including specific uses for $Dwar tokens, will make it easier for players to understand the benefits of playing the game. This can be supplemented with an in-depth FAQs section.
### Strengthen Community Engagement:
A dedicated community section with live updates, developer blogs, and interaction opportunities through forums or Discord integration would help foster a sense of community around Destiny War. Regular updates about the game’s development and upcoming features will also help build trust among players and investors.
### Enhance Roadmap Visibility:
The roadmap should be made more prominent and regularly updated. Any milestones or achievements reached during the game's development should be highlighted to demonstrate progress

## Conclusion & Offer for Development:
The Destiny War project demonstrates significant potential in the growing blockchain gaming market, offering a combination of MMORPG mechanics and the increasingly popular Play-to-Earn model. However, the current issues with non-functional buttons (such as "Click to Play" and "Approve") and a lack of detailed gameplay and tokenomics explanations hinder user engagement and understanding.
